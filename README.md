# horiseonservices
I added semantic HTML elements to the source code provided. 
I edited the HTML file that the elements followed a logical structure coherent with the design and user experience of the page.
I added ALT elements to the images for accessibility. 
I edited the title of the Web page to "Horiseon Social Solution Services," to increase search engine optimization.
